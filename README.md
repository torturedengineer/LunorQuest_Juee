### 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the long-term decline of coral reefs in the Florida Keys using CREMP datasets (2023).  
We used machine learning models — Random Forest, Prophet, and LSTM — to forecast coral cover, identify early warning indicators, and simulate the impact of future climate scenarios (+2°C warming).

### 🔮 Key Findings
- Coral cover is projected to continue declining without urgent conservation.
- Disease prevalence and species richness emerged as key indicators.
- Scenario simulation under +2°C warming predicts extreme reef vulnerability.
- Random Forest models achieved over 98% predictive accuracy.
