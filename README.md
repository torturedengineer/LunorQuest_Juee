### 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the long-term decline of coral reefs in the Florida Keys using CREMP datasets (2023).  
We used machine learning models — Random Forest, Prophet, and LSTM — to forecast coral cover, identify early warning indicators, and simulate the impact of future climate scenarios (+2°C warming).
